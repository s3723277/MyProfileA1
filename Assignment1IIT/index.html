								<p>My nationality is Macedonian, both my parents are Macedonian however, while my dad was born in other there, my mum was born in Australia. To be fair, I'm honestly more Australian than I am Macedonian. I speak a lot less Macedonian than I really should know, it’s more like very basic phrases that I actually know, such as 'hey, how are you' and 'can I have some water'
Throughout my childhood I was always that kid that only wanted to go to one primary and high school however, that was the complete opposite of what actually happened. From only wanting to go to one school, I ended up somehow shuffling around through 4 different schools. My first primary school was Movelle Primary school from prep to year 3, then having to move due to my sister starting high school at ICA collage where I completed year 4 and 5, to then complete my primary schooling at Kororoit Creek Primary as ICA had to shut down through embezzlement issue! I then thankfully completed all my high school at Westbourne Grammar School, before coming to RMIT!
a>.</p>
								<p>I'm currently playing senior soccer for a semi-professional club, Preston Lions Soccer Club. It's a huge honour for me to play at the club as it has been around since 1947 and has a great deal of history behind it! Winning some of the highest accolades a club could achieve back in the early 2000s. My aim for the club is to help them get promoted from state league 1 to the top flight of Australian football (NPL) and rightfully put them back to where they should have been all along! I've been playing soccer since I was 9 years old and I'm turning 20 this year, so it’s been a fair amount of years playing this game, definitely a lot of time spent training and putting in the hard yards to get to where I am now. </p>

								<p>My main hobby would probably be playing soccer. When I was younger that’s all I used to do, essentially the term 'eat, train, sleep, repeat'. When I wasn’t at training or forcefully doing homework, I was at a soccer pitch or park with soccer friends mucking around. It wasn't until high school where I had to decrease the amount of time I spent away from my laptop and school work otherwise I was going to be in trouble with not only my school but my parents. At least more so with my mum, as my dad was really wanting me to be a soccer player rather than an academic. I own two dogs, one being a Maltese shiatzu and the other being a cross Maltese shiatzu, cross jack Russel, cross Pomeranian. Both I guess you could say, are nowhere near obedient, with as little knowledge for tricks as possible, and very rare understanding of what the phrase 'sit' means.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</b> 

<p>I don’t know what my one sole interest in IT would be, as I don’t have anything that I’m super passionate about in the industry and there is such a variety within the world of IT, how could you pick one! I do, however, believe there are aspects to certain things we can achieve in IT that can be interesting to learn and try and understand. In particular, I think cloud computing and augmented reality tickles my fancy. I just find the idea of cloud computing so fascinating. Like where is everything stored? How do we manage to be able to get all our documents and information from the one same source on four different devices? It’s interesting how an interconnected network of servers manages to store and process information. I find that, with most things in IT, cloud computing is ever evolving and providing us with new ways to store and manage data in easier ways and will continue to be the predominate way for data management, especially with big companies. </p>
								<p>Then there’s augmented reality, which honestly baffles me. It’s basically just real-life Star Wars and holograms. I don’t see how anybody couldn’t be fascinated by the fact that we could basically have goggles that make it a real life iron man simulator, allowing us to get up the latest news, our most recent texts, and our latest YouTube videos right in front of us as we perform other functions. It’s definitely the way of the future and I for one am super excited by it. My interest in IT pretty much stemmed from playing video games at home and wondering what type of technology allowed us to develop such things that gave us enjoyment being away from the outdoors! I’ve also got a few family members in the IT industry which give it a high recommendation and encourage me to pursue a career in the industry as there’s a few bits of money involved! My interests in cloud computing and AR didn’t come about until recently, as it was only until a couple years ago that I actually started to comprehend and understand what this technology meant!</p>

								<b>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</b>

<p>Well that’s a pretty easy answer, because its obviously the best uni….</p> 

<p>Aside from all the jokes, I decided to come to RMIT University because it obviously offered a course that I thought would spark some interest for me, and along with the fact that it was a bit more specific than other courses provided at other universities such as Bachelor of Science. RMIT was also in a convenient spot for me, as it is located pretty much in the middle of everywhere, making it an easy fluid commute. 
</p>

								<b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b>

<p>What I expect to learn throughout my study at RMIT from the Bachelor of Information Technology is a variety of techniques that could provide me with the knowledge to tackle different types of jobs within the industry. Whether that be learning about the connections between online servers, learning how to program/code, learning about the types of hardware that is implemented into servers, and computers. Along with learning simple techniques on how to provide better security to my computers and security breaking techniques. Overall, I’m excited to try and learn as much as I can from what my course offers to then provide me with the greatest opportunity in the future to gain a job and to find my ideal job!

							<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/38581672?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=6433e388-43c3-4290-b844-f6da1983dada </p>

							<p>So essentially, what I believe this job to entail is being the leader of a group of gaming enthusiasts that produce free to play games and MMOs. So being in this role, I would have to be the lead person to give the go ahead on new projects, providing the groups of employees with financial and marketing support, providing them with my ideas on what to incorporate into their games to improve on them and ensure that the employees all stay on task and remain focused by providing them with an end vision/goal.</p>

							<p>What makes this role appealing for me is essentially being my own boss, having my own flexible hours, the benefits associated with the job, because who really doesn’t want free yoga…. The pay associated with the role is absolutely ridiculous, and I love games! Being able to help develop a game that millions of people could be playing is enough for me to want to jump on board!</p>

							<p>Well from what I gather from the job description and others alike, a great deal of experience is required to be able to take charge of your own team and manage them. It appears that a minimum of 3-5 years of experience as a manger is required, along with a thorough understanding and adept skills in software engineering, as developing a video game would require a lot of 3D rendering and software development. Being a manager comes great responsibility, as you are the one who needs to communicate deadlines, goals, achievements and acknowledgement of good work. So being a product manager will require exceptional communication skills to achieve success. </p>
							

<p>At the current stage, I might be a little bit unqualified for this role… I currently have very minimal knowledge of software engineering and experience in programming. I know the very basics at the moment, as I’m relying on 4 weeks’ worth of an introduction course. I don’t currently have experience in a manager role in regard to the workforce, I do however have a fair bit of experience in leading a team of individuals through my sporting commitments. I have captained numerous squads that I have played for, and thus has developed my leadership and communication skills. Similar to the workforce, I have to highlight the end goal, whether that be for the year or the upcoming game. I have to acknowledge achievements of teammates when credit is due, and I also have to be hard and demanding on my teammates when necessary, exposing me to different situations as a leader. I also have a strong understanding of technology and development as I try to keep up to date with all the new features coming out in the industry. I feel as if in this day and age, growing up surrounded by technology has helped me to gain understanding of tech far more quickly than the older generations.</p>		

							<p>My plan to gather these skills consist of;</p>

<p>	For developing my software engineering/programming skills, I will at the start, complete my required course and degree for Information Technology. As this job may require a higher level of skill in programming, I might need to undertake another degree at University, whether that be the Bachelor of Computer Science, or the Bachelor of Software Engineering. Along with these degrees and their associated programming courses, I will attend as many student run services that provide tutoring for programming. I will try and apply for as many internships that involve and are hopefully heavily software engineering based, to expose myself to the environment and the demands a job such as this requires. </p>

<p>	Pushing myself out of my comfort zone in terms of social and working situations which require higher levels of communication skills- these may include circumstances such as, asking more questions whether in class or at future internships as well as assisting in areas of conflict resolution. Furthermore, ensuring that constructive feedback is always requested to constantly progress my skills when regarding communication.

<span class="image main"><img src="images/Picture3.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In terms of the results, I actually think they’re quite accurate. For the creativity test, my curiosity and paradox appeared to be the main strength of my creativity. I’m quite pleased with curiosity being my main strength, as i believe for growth as a person, being curious is a necessity to develop as an individual, as it constantly forces yourself to question things and learn. Another attribute that stood out in these tests are my selflessness and willingness to help others around me, along with my loyalty to whatever cause I’m currently tackling. For me, it’s nice to have these attributes noticed, as I feel fulfilment.</p>

								<p>In regard to how this will affect my behaviour in a team, I feel as if it’ll be a positive experience. My natural mindset of wanting to help others is already a good sign for a team member in my opinion. Although my communication skills can be quite good, I sometimes tend to keep things to myself when I have an issue or problem. Whether that be with not being to get my program to function or not, or issues outside of work. As it appears, it could have a negative impact on my team if I were to continue to behave that way however, an upside to this, is that, it’s a simple fix. Overall, I believe my current personality results would be an overall positive experience for a team of individuals working towards one goal. </p>


								<p>When choosing or developing a team, as much as I’d want to have people that have similar personalities and traits to myself, I feel the most effective team would consist of a large variety of personalities. That way everyone can learn off of everyone and provide a different outlook on the task at hand, providing the most diversity to answer a question. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
								
							<b>Overview:</b>
							
							<b>mtVNYL</b>
<p>Some people still cling onto their vinyl collections due to perhaps old age, and afraid of change. However, could it possibly be the fact that listening to a vinyl provides the listener with a better sound over its ever-growing streaming service competitor? That’s exactly right, to this day, people argue that vinyl provides better sound quality than a mp3 file due to lossless compression which is described as ‘a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.’ So, what I’ve decided to come up with is to develop an app that scans the vinyl and plays it through a built-in record player on your smart device.
</p>

							<b>Motivation:</b>


							<p>My motivation in regard to developing this project idea is that, like previously stated, a large amount of people still prefers vinyls over a streaming service, with ‘vinyls accounting to 12% of all album sales in the United States in 2018’ as stated by Statista. I’m also a fan of my vinyl collection, as I personally think having the physical evidence of an LP is something to boast about. Through the app, you’ll be able to take your beloved vinyls anyway you want and show off to anybody what your collection looks like. Through a free app, it won’t be like a streaming service where you have to pay a monthly fee, it will be provided free of charge. The only thing you would have to pay for are the vinyl’s which you already have!</p>


							<b>Description:</b>

							<p>So how the mtVNYL works is that, similarly to the app Shazam, I would scan the vinyl for an audio fingerprint however, often an acoustic fingerprint is a condensed digital summary, and where the predicament lies, is the fact that a vinyl produces an analog frequency. To cater for this, I will create a new database, unlike the one already developed for digital recordings, this will be entirely made up of analog recordings, to be able to distinguish between a vinyl recording and digital production of a song. So essentially, the vinyl database will be transferred into a digital signal, however, will maintain its analog integrity encapsulating the vinyl experience on the go. The idea of transferring your vinyl to your smart device is to maintain the vinyl integrity and sound quality, even after use, eliminating the prospect of wear and tear on the record. Often with vinyl records, they get exposed to worn out and damaged needles, which then damage the vinyl itself, and ultimately decrease life span of the record. What mtVNYL intends to achieve is protect and increase longevity of the vinyl itself, allowing for a longer lifespan than the proposed 1-5 years. Through importing your beloved collection of vinyls to your smart device, you’ll be able to have greater accessibility than ever before with your favourite hits on the go through increased portability. Along with the increased accessibility and portability, mtVNYL intends to eliminate the chance of distortion from weather or storage conditions. Vinyls lifespan and recordings are often tampered with when they encounter any weather conditions other than a dark cool room. As soon as they are exposed to light, they can become distorted and altered. This can also be seen happening when the needle becomes lost above the vinyl, often due to lack of pressure from the arm itself, causing the needle to jump to place to place.</p>


							<b>Tools and Technologies:</b>

							<p>A collection of technologies will need to be incorporated to produce the smart app mtVNYL. To begin, a software engineer will need to be established to create the bases and fundamentals of the app, delivering functionality. We will need to develop a new database to store all the vinyl recordings, along with a functioning operating system of iOS or Android. We would also need to include acoustic fingerprints, in order to trap and categorise the recordings, to then be able to relate it back to a spectrogram. Ultimately, we would also need a functioning hardware device such as a smart phone, which would be able to download the mtVNYL app.</p>


							<b>Skills Required:</b>

							<p>This goes hand in hand with the tools and technologies. In order to operate the tools we have access to, we have to be able to understand and acknowledge what it is we are using. As stated in the above paragraph, in order to get the app to function, we need someone who is adept in software engineering and is able to use a programming language which is best suited for the app. In this case, I have decided to continue with java, as it is universally known and has lots of functionality to it. To be able to understand databases, we need to ensure that we have the skills to acknowledge where data is being stored and maintained. Finally, we will need to be able to understand signal transmissions and frequencies, in order to comprehend acoustic fingerprints and the spectrogram. In terms of feasibility for this project, it definitely can be done, as there are so many similar projects these days, and the demand for app development is currently booming.</p>


							<b>Outcome:</b>


							<p>If the project were to be successful, I would encourage you vinyl lovers to download the app! Hopefully, the music industry will appreciate the development of the app, encouraging artists to continue to developing vinyl records of their albums. With the end goal of continuing to help artists grow and provide music lovers to experience music to the highest audio quality, whilst eliminating any opportunity for vinyls to have a decreased life span!
